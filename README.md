# Notes
 - Ms. Stretten is a really, *really* dreadful teacher because she doesn't really teach anything and has a bad accent, but if you grit your teeth and do all your work and hand in all your assignments, you'll pass the course.
 - I took this course in March of 2020 when we went into COVID-19 lockdown, so we skipped a lot of important stuff in the course. Nevertheless, you may find my homework and assignments useful.
 - A course outline was also not provided in class, so I listed the concepts of what I remembered off the top of my head, and grouped them as best as I could.
