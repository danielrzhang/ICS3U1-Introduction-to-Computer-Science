# ICS3U1-Introduction-to-Computer-Science
Homework and assignments from RHHS's ICS3U1 (Grade 11 Computer Science) course.

# Instructor
Ms. Stretten

# Notes
 - Ms. Stretten is a really bad teacher because she doesn't really teach and has an accent, but if you grit your teeth and hand in all your tests and assignments, you'll pass the course.
 - I took this course in March of 2020 when we went into COVID-19 lockdown, so we skipped a lot of important stuff in the course. Nevertheless, you may find my work useful.
