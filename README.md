# ICS3U1-Introduction-to-Computer-Science
Homework and assignments from RHHS's ICS3U1 (Grade 11 Computer Science) course.

# Instructor
Ms. Stretten

# Concepts Covered
 - 


# Notes
 - Ms. Stretten is a really, *really* bad teacher because she doesn't really teach anything and has a bad accent, but if you grit your teeth and do all your work and hand in all your assignments, you'll pass the course.
 - I took this course in March of 2020 when we went into COVID-19 lockdown, so we skipped a lot of important stuff in the course. Nevertheless, you may find my homework and assignments useful.
